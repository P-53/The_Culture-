 https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html this help me alot with the code and doing this type of work. 

note: The code that was used to cluster cell types together was optimized for mouse cell ,not zebra fish cells this was done because there's no code exists to group this cell clusters together for zebrafish.
